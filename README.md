# Landing-Page

In this project I am going to be recreating a landing page from scratch. I will be testing my skills on many different concepts within html and css.

Recap:
After completing this project I feel confident in my HTML and CSS skills and feel like I can successfully build different landing pages. I used flexbox a lot during the creation of this landing page and I am getting better with using it.
